## AI in web developement

AI has been around for some time, but since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, its integration into many aspects of development has accelerated. Major tech firms such as OpenAI, Shopify, Instacart, NVIDIA, and Uber, along with businesses like Brex, Stripe, and Ramp, are already leveraging AI. The question now is: how?

There are three main ways AI is being used in web development:

- Planning – using AI to brainstorm, research, and outline projects.

- Building – generating code, automating tasks, and speeding up development.

- Implementing – integrating AI features directly into products for end users.

As a result, junior developers are increasingly expected to think more like project leads, using AI as an extension of their development team. This can speed up production by streamlining workflows and making room for more product design.
